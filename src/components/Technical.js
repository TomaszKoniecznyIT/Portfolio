          I graduated from the Electronic Technical School in Wa≈Çbrzych,
          attaining the title of Electronics Technician with a specialization in
          Digital Systems. This school was a purely technical institution, where
          our education encompassed a comprehensive range of topics. Starting
          from the fundamentals of electronics, we progressed to the assembly of
          computers, gaining insights into their principles of operation, and
          delving into the programming of integrated circuits as well as
          computer software.
