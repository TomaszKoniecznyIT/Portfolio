        I embarked on my coding journey with Python. Once I had mastered the
        fundamentals, I started tackling challenges on platforms like Codewars.
        To diversify my coding practice, I decided to create a fully functional
        application that could be used interactively. However, I was lacking
        inspiration. It was during a moment spent beside my wife, who was
        engrossed in a simple logic game on her laptop, that an idea struck me:

        of such a game? This sparked the inception of my first independent
        project.{" "}
